I've been working remotely for over a decade, both as a self-employed consultant and now for Automattic. My office setup has evolved significantly. From a portable setup to working at the living room table in my first studio apartment in Barcelona, and now to a dedicated office space, it’s been quite the journey. Now that I’ve settled in Spain, I’m more comfortable investing in larger, more permanent office items.  

While my setup is always a work in progress, here’s what works for me.


## Computer Setup  
My primary computer is a **Mac Studio** connected to an **Apple Studio Display**. I also use a 24-inch **Samsung monitor** rotated vertically, which is perfect for Slack and Obsidian. It’s positioned just far enough away that I need to turn my head — a handy trick to minimize distractions.  

This setup reflects a battle with concentration. I’ve experimented with multi-monitor and ultra-wide configurations, but for me, a single primary screen paired with MacOS Spaces is ideal.  

The **Studio Display** is my favorite so far. The speakers are good enough for music, and the built-in camera works fine for video calls as long as there’s sufficient light.  

When traveling for work, I rely on a 13-inch **MacBook Pro M1** and an **iPad Air** as a second monitor. I use GNU Stow to keep my machines in sync.


### Peripherals  
I use a **ZSA Voyager split keyboard**, paired with an **Apple Trackpad** placed between the two halves. This ergonomic setup has helped prevent shoulder pain and has the added bonus of improving my typing speed. The split layout encourages proper touch-typing technique and hand placement, a fun, unexpected benefit.  


## Other Office Essentials  

### A Dedicated Room  
Having a separate room for work is essential. It allows me to physically step away from work when I’m done. I’ve also personalized the space with items that inspire me: model cars, travel photos, Lego builds, and art.  

### Chair and Desk  
I use a **Herman Miller Embody chair** and a **sit-stand desk** from **Autonomous.ai**. Instead of the default desk surface, I opted for a solid wood tabletop from a local sawmill — it was cheaper, easier to ship, and added character to the space.  

### Lighting  
Good lighting makes all the difference. I’ve installed **Hue smart bulbs**, integrated with **Home Assistant** and **Apple Home** (via the HomeKit Bridge), to create lighting scenes for day and night. For video calls, I rely on an **Elgato Key Light**. 

Natural light streams in from a large window, and I adjust artificial lighting based on the time of day. Cool, white light works best during the day, while warmer tones (and sometimes fun colors) set the mood for late-night coding sessions.  

### Mic and Audio  
For calls, I use a **Røde NT-USB mic** — simple, reliable, and with no need for an audio interface. For deeper focus or meetings, I pair it with **Apple AirPods Pro**.  

## Tools I Use  

- **Obsidian**: My go-to for note-taking and building a personal knowledge base. I’ve used Obsidian since its launch, syncing notes across devices with Obsidian Sync and even writing blog posts like this one.  
- **NeoVIM**: My primary code editor, though I’m also testing **Cursor**, which embeds NeoVIM. As a terminal-first user, I’m keen on finding the right workflow that integrates AI agents for NeoVIM.  
- **Stopwatch/Timer**: I use the minimal **Tempus Stopwatch** to track time. I used **Time-Warrior** for a long time, and I may start using it more again. While my company doesn’t require time tracking, I find it helpful for understanding task durations and staying focused. Over time, it has made me better at creating realistic to-do lists and estimating how long tasks take. I log these insights in Obsidian as part of my daily notes.  
- **Brain.fm**: While I’m not 100% sure if it scientifically boosts focus, pairing Brain.fm with my timer helps me enter deep work mode faster.  


While my setup may evolve, this mix of tools, tech, and thoughtful design keeps me productive and happy while working from home.
