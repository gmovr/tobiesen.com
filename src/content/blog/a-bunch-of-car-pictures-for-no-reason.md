I've always loved cars. My dream car is still a Porsche 911, but I'm pretty happy with my current daily driver: my 2023 Huyundai i30N Performance. In the correct color, of course: Performance Blue. 

It's a lot of fun, with the 2.0L turbocharged, 280hp engine and the 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission I prefer it over the Golf GTI and other "hot hatches".

Since I work remotely, I don't need a car. It's 100% unnecessary. Let's be real here: my commute is about 20 steps, 100 if I make coffee first -- but I do love road trips.

Every time we go on a road trip, I take some pictures of my car at different places!
