			Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and <a href="https://nownownow.com"
				>Nownownow.com</a>. Updated Monday, January 20th, 2025, from Barcelona, Spain.

		<ul>
			<li>I'm working on Spanish growth projects and engineering hiring for Automattic.</li>
			<li>I’m based in a small town just a short drive from Barcelona, Spain.</li>
			<li>My upcoming travel plans include Japan, Milan, Lake Como, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.</li>
			<li>
				My goals are to run more, improve my 5K time, travel more, relax more, cook more, and spend
				less time in front of a computer screen.
			</li>
			<li>
				I’m currently learning Golang, reading more about stoicism, and trying to write more on this
				blog — <a href="https://veselin.blog/2025/01/24/365-days/">inspired by a coworker</a>.
