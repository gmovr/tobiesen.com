			Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and <a href="https://nownownow.com"
				>Nownownow.com</a>. Updated Monday, January 20th, 2025, from Barcelona, Spain.

		<ul>
			<li>🚀 I'm working on Spanish growth projects and engineering hiring for Automattic.</li>
			<li>🏡 I’m based in a small town just a short drive from Barcelona, Spain.</li>
			<li>✈️ My upcoming travel plans include Japan, Milan, Lake Como, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.</li>
			<li>🎯 My goals are to run more, improve my 5K time, travel more, relax more, cook more, and spend less time in front of a computer screen.</li>
			<li>🤔 Still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up.</li>
			<li>💻 I’m currently learning Golang, reading more about stoicism and architecture— and trying to write more on this blog <a href="https://veselin.blog/2025/01/24/365-days/">inspired by a coworker</a>.</li>
